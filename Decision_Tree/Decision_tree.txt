What is the train_test_split function in Sklearn?
The train_test_split function of the sklearn.model_selection package in Python splits arrays or matrices into random subsets for train and test data, respectively

What is random_state?
random_state is a parameter in train_test_split that controls the random number generator used to shuffle the data before splitting it. In other words, it ensures that the same randomization is used each time you run the code, resulting in the same splits of the data.
